A funny project where I've created a [crewAI tool](tools%2Farduino.py) for connecting
this framework with my Arduino UNO. The code we are going to generate (using
Ollama's Llama3) is going to be very simple, just turning on an off a series of
three leds. In future tutorials, we'll try to make something more complex ...
